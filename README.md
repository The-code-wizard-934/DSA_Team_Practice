🚀 DSA Team Practice Repository
===============================

Welcome to the **DSA-Team-Practice** repository.This repository is designed for a group of learners to practice **Data Structures & Algorithms** together while keeping:

*   Individual ownership
    
*   Zero code conflicts
    
*   Proper Git workflow
    
*   Portfolio-ready structure
    

Even if you are completely new to GitHub or coding, this repo will guide you step-by-step.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
-----------------------------

1.  Help every member practice DSA in their own space
    
2.  Track individual progress
    
3.  Learn Git & collaboration
    
4.  Build interview-ready solutions
    
5.  Create a public coding portfolio
    

👉 Each person has their **own Questions + Solutions folder**, so no one overwrites another’s work.

🧩 How This System Works (Simple Explanation)
---------------------------------------------

Think of this repository like a classroom:

*   Every student has their **own notebook (folder)**
    
*   Teacher does NOT force one common answer
    
*   Everyone solves the same or different problems
    
*   All solutions stay together in one repo
    

So:

✔ No conflict✔ No partiality✔ No overwriting✔ Fair for everyone

👤 Member Workspace Concept
---------------------------

Every member gets:

### 1\. Personal Question Bank

Members//Questions/

You write:

*   Problem names
    
*   Links
    
*   status
    

### 2\. Personal Solutions

Members//Solutions/

*   You can code in any language
    
*   C++ / Java / Python allowed
    
*   One file per problem
    

### 3\. Progress Tracker

Members//Progress.md

Track:

*   solved
    
*   revision
    
*   pending
    

✅ What Goes to Main Branch?
---------------------------

Main branch will contain:

*   All members’ folders
    
*   Everyone’s independent solutions
    
*   No single “best answer”
    

👉 Main = Collection of all learning👉 Not one person’s code

Example:
```
main├── Members/Yash/Solutions/two\_sum.cpp
    ├── Members/member1/Solutions/two\_sum.java
    └── Members/member2/Solutions/two\_sum.py

All are valid and stored together.
```
🧠 Daily Workflow
-----------------

### Step 1 – Choose Problem

Add entry in:

Members/Yash/Questions/Arrays.md

Example:

1.  Two Sum – [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)...
    
2.  Best Time to Buy Stock
    

### Step 2 – Write Solution

Create file:

Members/Yash/Solutions/Arrays/two\_sum.cpp

With format:
```
// Problem: Two Sum
// Platform: LeetCode
// Question: 1 (platform question number) 
// Difficulty: Easy
// Approach: Hashmap
// Time: O(n)
// Space: O(n)

 {// code}
```

### Step 3 – Push to GitHub
```
git add .
git commit -m "add: two sum solution"
git push

```
🚨 Golden Rules
---------------

### You MUST:

✔ Work only inside your folder✔ Follow file format✔ Write complexity✔ Use clean naming

### You must NOT:

❌ Edit others’ code❌ Delete folders❌ Mix multiple problems in one file❌ Push build/exe files

🧪 Supported Languages
----------------------

*   C++
    
*   Java
    
*   Python
    
*   JavaScript

Learning focused ❤️

❓ FAQ
-----

### 1\. If all solve same question?

No issue!Everyone stores in their folder.

### 2\. Which solution goes to main?

ALL solutions go to main inside respective folders.

### 3\. Will there be conflict?

NO – because paths are different.
